      "The hospital is equipped with modern facilities, experienced core medical and non-core medical personnel to deliver excellent medical services to her patients",
      "It's fairly okay. The usual Nigerian standard of public facility. Usually crowded. Go early so you can leave early",
      "Stressful like any other public or general hospitals but effective",
      "It is a secondary health facility. The compound of the hospital is not spacious so they have limited space for car park which mostly reserved for staffs of the hospital",
      "Lagos State Government General Hospital with a Class known for being the saviour of Pregnant Women & Children where the Low-income earners are highly dominated"
